\title{StochKit2R: a package for efficient discrete stochastic simulation using the Gillepie Algorithm (SSA) and tau-leaping}
\description{
The package provides an R interface to stochastic simulation functions and 
provides functions for generating plots of the simulation data.
}
\section{Simulation functions}{

There are three simulation functions: ssa, ssaSingle and tauLeaping. 
ssa and tauLeaping run ensembles (many simulations) and store output at uniformly
spaced time intervals. By default they store means and variances, but trajectories
and histogram data can also be stored. ssaSingle runs a single trajectory and
stores a row of output for every reaction event that occurs.  Consult the individual
function help functions or the User Manual vignette for more information.
}

\section{Plotting functions}{

There are four plotting functions: plotStats, plotTrajectories, plotHistogram, and histogramDistance 
For plotting stats, trajectories, and histogram data. Consult the individual function help functions
or the User Manual vignette for more information.
